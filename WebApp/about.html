                <h4>The Charts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A <b>Round Tree Chart</b> is used to represent the knockout games for each round. Every layer in the tree represent a round. The outer most layer is Round 1, next layer is Round 2, and so forth, With the center representing the Winner of the series. Each layer also has a watermark label with the round name on it.

                                <b>Donut charts</b> are used to represent statistics like Aces, Total Points, Winner and Error. This helps the viewer to easily identify the strengths and weaknesses of the player during that game.
                                It also helps to compare the winner and the loser of the game with each other.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A <b>Column Chart</b> is used for stats like First Serve, First Point Won, Second POint Won, Break, Return and Net. This data is represented as percentages. Hence the visualization not only helps the comparison between the winner and loser for a given skill, but also helps to know what skill contributed to the total points of the player for a game.

                        <b>Hover over</b> the donut charts to see more details about the data it is representing.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        US Open games take place in Hard Surface courts. The colour of the <b>Round Tree Knockout Chart</b> is the color of the hard surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For every game, the winner is represented using a darker color than the color used to represent the loser. This makes the winner data more prominent in the chart.

                    </li>
                </ul>
